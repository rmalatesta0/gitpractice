Think of these thoughts as limitless light
Exposing closing circuitry of fright
Think of each moment holding this breath
As death minute in decimal
Resident minor, how do you plead?
We'll need your testimony on the stand
Solemnly swear to tell the whole truth
So help you son, now raise your right hand

My brain has claimed its glory over me

I order you to cower and pray
Nuns commence incanting as the lightning strikes mine temples thus
Electrifying mine chambers, wholly scorching out thine sovereignty
So-so-so-so-so-so-so-so spiraling down thy majesty

See how the brain plays around
And you fall inside a hole you couldn't see
And you fall inside a hole inside a-
Someone help me
Understand what's going on inside my mind
Doctor I can't tell if I'm not me
When it grows bright, the particles start to
Marvel having made it through the night
Never they ponder, weather electric
Calming if you look at it right!
